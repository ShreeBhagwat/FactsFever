Started FactsFever 2 years ago as a telegram channel, where I and the
other admins used to post facts. So that the subscribers could gain
knowledge. At start it was just for fun and something to pass time.
The channel grew fast and we did hit 10k Subs soon (Currently 25k and
growing ). It was all the hard work of the team which gathered the
facts around. Soon a time pass was changed into passion and we
started feeling good for sharing facts. </SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Helvetica Neue, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><SPAN LANG="en-US">	Later
did we realized that the so-called facts which were readily available
are now getting scare and rare, as we had already uploaded the facts
which were easy to find. Now it was our time to dive deep into the
ocean to search for some of the rare and amazing facts which will
truly amaze us. This was going well and we stated taking ads on our
channel and grew faster.</SPAN><BR></FONT></FONT></FONT><BR>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Helvetica Neue, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><SPAN LANG="en-US">	But
money was not the profit here. When we were searching facts to post
on channel, unknowingly we gathered a lot of information. There were
many things which we understood, which classes or tuitions could have
never taught us. Our knowledge increased and we slowly felt that we
must put these facts somewhere else so that we can reach more people
with whom we can share our knowledge and dazzle them with the things
going around the world. </SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT>

time I just started learning to code, as coding gave me satisfaction
and this was my new hobby. I was a newbie and I happen to get a Mac
which shifted my coding Language towards swift. I wanted to develop
an app and I used to search on YouTube for tutorials and blogpost for
App Development. At first I did not even know the basics of language
and being a self-taught programmer it was hard to gets doubts cleared
as there was no place to ask for, moreover my doubts were so silly
that Stack Overflow would make fun of me. But with persistence and
patience I had finally learned a a few things in app development. </SPAN><BR></FONT></FONT></FONT><BR>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Helvetica Neue, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><SPAN LANG="en-US">	To
try out my skill and take a deep dive into the world of coding I
decided to make a FactsFever app where I can post Facts and people
will scroll thru the facts. This was just plain and simple workflow
and layout. Where it will display images of facts and user can scroll
to the next one. My only requirement to me was that this will be real
time facts app. Normally the facts app present in the app store has
their facts preset into the app, and for new facts you need to update
your app. So, it was somewhere limited and I did now what this. So, I
was successful</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Helvetica Neue, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><SPAN LANG="en-US">In
creating this app and gave it for review. But Apple as we all know
has strict Guideline laws, resulted in my app getting rejected and I
had to add extra features and make it creative. This forced me to
learn new things and ways of the coding world. </SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT>

as a user I came to know one thing that is. No one wakes up excited
to see more advertising, no one goes to sleep thinking about the ads
they'll see tomorrow. We know people are excited to learn something
new. To understand the confusing. Curiosity drives them I want
FactsFever to be that part of your life that keeps you awake in
search of knowledge... and that you reach for in the morning. No one
jumps up from a nap and runs to see an advertisement.</SPAN><BR><BR>	<SPAN LANG="en-US">So
yes people ask me why are you not putting ads in this App, or what’s
the benefits are you getting behind this app and many more questions.
Little did they know that I have already received the benefits of
this app. Which is more than the money I can ever get form the ads.
Moreover, the main aim of this app to spread knowledge and
information. Children of all ages are kept in mind and hence keeping
this app free and ad free for them and me is must. </SPAN><BR>		</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
